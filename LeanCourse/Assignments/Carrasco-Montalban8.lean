/- You can use `filter_upwards` to conveniently conclude `Eventually` statements from `Eventually`
in one or more hypotheses using the same filter. -/
example {ι : Type*} {L : Filter ι} {f g : ι → ℝ} (h1 : ∀ᶠ i in L, f i ≤ g i)
    (h2 : ∀ᶠ i in L, g i ≤ f i) : ∀ᶠ i in L, f i = g i := by
  filter_upwards [h1, h2] with i h1 h2
  exact le_antisymm h1 h2

example {ι : Type*} {L : Filter ι} {a b : ι → ℤ} (h1 : ∀ᶠ i in L, a i ≤ b i + 1)
    (h2 : ∀ᶠ i in L, b i ≤ a i + 1) (h3 : ∀ᶠ i in L, b i ≠ a i) : ∀ᶠ i in L, |a i - b i| = 1 := by {

/- The goal of the following exercise is to prove that
the regular open sets in a topological space form a complete boolean algebra.
`U ⊔ V` is given by `interior (closure (U ∪ V))`.
`U ⊓ V` is given by `U ∩ V`. -/

@[ext] theorem ext (h : (U : Set X) = V) : U = V :=

/- First we want a complete lattice structure on the regular open sets.
We can obtain this from a so-called `GaloisCoinsertion` with the closed sets.
This is a pair of maps
* `l : RegularOpens X → Closeds X`
* `r : Closeds X → RegularOpens X`
with the properties that
* for any `U : RegularOpens X` and `C : Closeds X` we have `l U ≤ C ↔ U ≤ r U`
* `r ∘ l = id`
If you know category theory, this is an *adjunction* between orders
(or more precisely, a coreflection).

/- The closure of a regular open set. Of course mathlib knows that the closure of a set is closed.
(the `simps` attribute will automatically generate the simp-lemma for you that
`(U.cl : Set X) = closure (U : Set X)`

/- To be more concrete, we can use the previous lemma to prove the following.
if we denote the characteristic function of `A` by `1_A`, and `f : ℝ → ℝ` is a function,
then  `f * 1_{s i}` tends to `f * 1_t` iff `x ∈ s i` is eventually equivalent to
`x ∈ t` for all `x`. (note that this does *not* necessarily mean that `s i = t` eventually).
`f * 1_t` is written `indicator t f` in Lean.
Useful lemmas for this exercise are `indicator_apply`, `apply_ite` and `tendsto_pi_nhds`. -/
